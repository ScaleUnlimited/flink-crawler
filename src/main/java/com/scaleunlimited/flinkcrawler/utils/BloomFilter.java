/**
 * Implements a <i>Bloom filter</i>, as defined by Bloom in 1970.
 * <p>
 * The Bloom filter is a data structure that was introduced in 1970 and that has been adopted by 
 * the networking research community in the past decade thanks to the bandwidth efficiencies that it
 * offers for the transmission of set membership information between networked hosts.  A sender encodes 
 * the information into a bit vector, the Bloom filter, that is more compact than a conventional 
 * representation. Computation and space costs for construction are linear in the number of elements.  
 * The receiver uses the filter to test whether various elements are members of the set. Though the 
 * filter will occasionally return a false positive, it will never return a false negative. When creating 
 * the filter, the sender can choose its desired point in a trade-off between the false positive rate and the size.
