/**
 * Implements a <i>Bloom filter</i>, as defined by Bloom in 1970.
 * <p>
 * The Bloom filter is a data structure that was introduced in 1970 and that has been adopted by the networking research
 * community in the past decade thanks to the bandwidth efficiencies that it offers for the transmission of set
 * membership information between networked hosts. A sender encodes the information into a bit vector, the Bloom filter,
 * that is more compact than a conventional representation. Computation and space costs for construction are linear in
 * the number of elements. The receiver uses the filter to test whether various elements are members of the set. Though
 * the filter will occasionally return a false positive, it will never return a false negative. When creating the
 * filter, the sender can choose its desired point in a trade-off between the false positive rate and the size.
